# Why I Love WordPress

## Me & WordPress Go WAYY Back.

After my introduction to HTML and CSS years ago, I wanted to work with something a little more dynamic. I'm not really sure what brought WordPress and I together, but I'm sure glad it did. I got started just modifying existing themes to get them to look how I wanted. Having no PHP experience _at all_, I was definitely diving in to the deep end, but some people consider that the best way to learn to swim. 

Being able to develop custom solutions to businesses custom problems is a highly marketable skill. As I continued to experiment and learn more, I started to realize that WordPress can do pretty much anything. Even now I'm still building things with WordPress and there's a whole lot I don't know yet. (Using WordPress as a headless backend-CMS is up next on the list of things to figure out.) 

I've been using WordPress forever and it's definitely helped me launch my career to where it is today, and for that I am eternally grateful 

## It's Powerful and (can be) Fast

WordPress can be used to build anything from a simple blog to a fully featured custom application. It's, at it's core, an Authentication shell wrapped around a Library of Database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions. It comes pre-packaged as a blog, but from there, the sky's the limit on what you can make happen.

If you know what you're doing, cache as much as possible, & keep your plugin list in check, WordPress can be just as fast as any other site. You do need to know what you're doing though, as it's very easy to lose control and end up with a bloated, slower than molasses site. 

## Easy to Hand Off

The best sites for clients are the ones where I don't have to go in there to make every single little change to the content of the website. Using a library like [Kirki](https://kirki.org/) makes it insanely easy to set up every bit of text on the site as a setting that can be accessed from the WordPress Backend. 

Obviously I'm not going to turn down an ongoing maintenance contract, but without one, all of those "Hey, can you change \_\_\_\_ real quick?" can add up. So being able to hand off the final product to the client with enough control that they can change things _without_ breaking anything. 

# Why I Hate WordPress

## Plugins for EVERYTHING

With WordPress being such an open and popular platform, there are Plugins for LITERALLY Everything. You don't need a plugin for an announcement bar at the top of the page. You need a couple lines of PHP in the `functions.php` && `header.php` files of your theme. Every plugin you install doesn't need a free and a pro version.

Don't get me wrong, there are some fantastic Plugins that I use on every WordPress site. However, most of these tend to solve rather complex issues like security or e-commerce. 

With the massive amount of WordPress plugins on the market (almost 60,000), there comes a TON of WordPress content on how to solve particular problems WITH Plugins. Plugin This, Plugin That; and suddenly you've got 25 different plugins installed and running, your frontend starts to request into the hundreds of files, your site slows down, and nobody's happy. 


## Like Using A Nuke As A Fly Swatter

Like using [DUAL RTX 2080 TIs & A $2600 Processor](https://amzn.to/36RAkig) to browse Facebook & Play Bejeweled Blitz. Like using a Flamethrower to light a cigarette. 

Using the WordPress CLI, `wp core download` downloads a whopping 56mb worth of just the Core files. While that's not necessarily _HUGE_, a lot of sites built on WordPress don't use, and frankly don't need, a lot of the more advanced features built into the platform. Your local small business doesn't need tiered permission systems related to who can edit, view, & publish content. They probably only need 2 accounts: An owner with admin privs and an editor with everything short of admin privs. 

There are times where using WordPress just doesn't make sense. Primarily if the content of the site isn't going to change at all, or you want to push for more work for yourself down the line. 


# Use The Best Tool For The Job

At the end of the day I'm still going to reach for WordPress _most_ of the time because it's the tool I'm best equipped to hit the ground running with. With tools like WordMove, the WordPress CLI, and a couple custom Bash scripts I can get a new test site spun up rather quickly.
