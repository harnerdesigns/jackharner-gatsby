## Becoming a Full Time Freelancer without a Computer Science Degree ðŸ˜‰

I was asked to interview on the [No CS Degree](https://www.nocsdegree.com/self-taught-shopify-developer/) blog. The blog focuses on people working in tech and web development that never received a computer science degree. It's a testament to all the self / community taught developers out there, as well as the people who transitioned into tech later in their life. 

#### Thanks Pete for inviting me on!
