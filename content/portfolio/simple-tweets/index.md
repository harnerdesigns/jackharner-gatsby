## Zed's Dead Baby

This project got nipped in the bud when Twitter got rid of their free tier API Access. Since this project wasn't even off the ground yet, I decided to shutter it. Ironically, I started using [HypeFury](https://hypefury.com/?via=jackharner) shortly after to manage my tweet schedule. It's been pretty great so far.

## The History of Simple Tweets

Simple Tweets was an idea I had a while back. I envisioned a minimal tweeting tool that would allow you to schedule tweets without thinking about it.

I wanted to just brain dump tweets into a box, without spamming Twitter too hard. A Dam of sorts between Twitter and my brain, only letting a little trickle through at a time.

You login with Twitter, select how many times per day you want to tweet, and start brain dumping. That's it.

## Build Log

Slowly but surely making progress. That's why they call them side projects, right?
