Simple Tweets was an idea I had a while back. I envisioned a minimal tweeting tool that would allow you to schedule tweets without thinking about it.

I wanted to just brain dump tweets into a box, without spamming Twitter too hard. A Dam of sorts between Twitter and my brain, only letting a little trickle through at a time.

You login with Twitter, select how many times per day you want to tweet, and start brain dumping. That's it.
