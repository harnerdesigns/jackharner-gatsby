## White Label BigCommerce Development

I've worked with Weizen Young as a contractor for over a year now. In that time I went from being just a backup set of hands doing small bug fixes to one of the main developers working directly with their clients. 

Some examples of work I've done for their clients include: 

* Automating theme deployment and fetching code changes made through the File Editor
* Working with price lists & customer groups to provide premium pricing on certain products
* Improving customer usability throughout the store, cart, & checkout
* Developing custom widgets for easy content updates
* Accessibility (A11y) audits & fixes
* **And so much more!**

## Automating BigCommerce Theme Deployment

It all started when they found my blog post "[BigCommerce Stencil CI/CD with GitHub Actions](/blog/bigcommerce-stencil-ci-cd-with-github-actions/)". They wanted to automate the deployment process for their clients, and decided to enlist my help getting that all set up. With my help, we've improved the GitHub Actions workflow and implemented it for over a dozen clients. 

The deploy workflows allows us to easily track all the code changes through GitHub, update live themes right away, deploy to staging stores for review, update theme titles, and more.
