## I ❤️ Live Music. 

I don't really care who I'm seeing, or what genre, as long as the drinks are flowing and the music's loud. 

A while back I had this idea for a directory of all the live music happening in Colorado. I put together a pretty basic [Gatsby](/portfolio/tags/gatsby) site that fetches data from Airtable. I then wrote a handful of [Node](/portfolio/tags/node) scripts to read various API's to fetch all of the different Artist and Event data I needed to populate the site.

## Overcoming Growing Pains

As the database grew, I very quickly hit Airtable's limits for things so in the spring of 2024 I did a complete overhaul of the site and everything behind it. Now it runs on [WordPress](/portfolio/tags/wordpress) and everything's stored in MySQL.

The site's still a work in progress, but if you live in the Colorado area and love live music, I'd love for you to sign up for the [Newsletter](https://livemusicforecast.com/live-music-digest) to follow along with the progress!
