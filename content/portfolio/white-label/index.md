## White Label BigCommerce Development

I've worked with several agencies as a contractor for my entire freelance career. In that time I been everything from just a backup set of hands doing small bug fixes to one of the main developers working directly with clients. 

Some examples of work I've done for clients include: 

* Automating theme deployment and fetching code changes made through the File Editor
* Working with price lists & customer groups to provide premium pricing on certain products
* Improving customer usability throughout the store, cart, & checkout
* Developing custom widgets for easy content updates
* Accessibility (A11y) audits & fixes
* **And so much more!**
