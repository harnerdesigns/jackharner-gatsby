## Click To Copy Material Design Color Codes

A Chrome & Firefox extension I developed that puts the Material Design color codes right at your fingertips. Click to copy HEX, #HEX, RGB, RGBA, HSL, & HSLA for whatever format color code you need.

I got tired of looking up the documentation every time I needed a color code. With over 1,700 weekly users across both browsers, quick access to one of the most popular color palettes was needed.
