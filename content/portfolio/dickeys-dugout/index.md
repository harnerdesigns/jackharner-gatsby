Dickeyâ€™s Dugout is a Georgia based Softball Training Center. They offer private lessons to improve all aspects of your game. 

They needed a site where their clients could schedule and pay for lessons ahead of time. They also wanted to offer a multi-leveled membership program, granting access to extra free lessons as well as other perks.

My role in this project included putting together most of the design as well as all of the code for the Shopify Theme.
