Midtown Metal, a leading metal manufacturer in Albuquerque, New Mexico, approached me for help in establishing an online presence to boost their SEO visibility and attract top-of-the-funnel traffic. Understanding the client's needs, I conducted a thorough analysis of the industry landscape and the target audience of Midtown Metal. I then designed and developed a customized website that highlighted the company's expertise, services, and unique value propositions. The website was designed to be user-friendly, with engaging content to resonate with potential customers and improve online visibility for Midtown Metal.

Working closely with Midtown Metal, I successfully launched a dynamic and optimized website that reflected the company's branding and objectives.
