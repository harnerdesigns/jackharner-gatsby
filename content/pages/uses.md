## What's A "Uses" Page?

A `/uses` page is a place for developers to share what tools, software, setups and configurations they use. It's a great resource for other people to add some tools to their workflow and find out what other people are using.

  * Built in Terminal
  * Loads Infinitely Faster than Sublime
  * Loads of Extensions and Themes
