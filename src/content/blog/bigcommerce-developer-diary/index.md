## Read My Diary ðŸ˜‰
I was asked to guest post on the BigCommerce Developer blog as part of their Developer Diaries series. The series looks at the general day to day of different people working in the e-commerce/BigCommerce space. I provided a look at my week working at [Shoolu](/portfolio/shoolu) and all the various things I do (and all the coffee I drink).

#### Thanks Karen and Laruen for inviting me on!
