CSS Grid is an insanely powerful new technology for the web. It's not really new, but a lot of people don't really understand fully how to use it. 

I wrote [The Grid Gospel](https://gridgospel.com) as part of the [#2WeekProduct](https://twitter.com/hashtag/2WeekProduct?src=hashtag_click) challenge on Twitter. A handful of other people were inspired by this tweet: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My advice to first-time info product creators:<br><br>1. Start with a very small product.<br><br>2. Choose a topic you know well that will almost write itself. Avoid doing research.<br><br>3. Timebox production to 2 weeks.<br><br>4. Charge $10.<br><br>5. Promote it!<br><br>All the lessons are in #5. Best of luck!</p>&mdash; Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1287210142459547648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2020</a></blockquote>

Basically it was a push to create some sort of informational product that you can sell, only give yourself 2 weeks to finish it, and sell it for $10. Seemed like a pretty decent challenge to partake in. 

Given the limited time span I had to pick something I was already pretty knowledgeable about, so I knew it was going to be based around CSS. I'd had the idea of doing a book about CSS Grid for a while and then I got invited to do the #2WeekProduct challenge I figured that was a pretty great time to do it. 

It started life as the "Untitled CSS Grid Ebook" before I settled on "The Grid Gospel". I didn't want to get too hung up on the name and the branding before I'd even wrote the thing, but I still wanted to tweet about it to build hype. 

Here's the Twitter thread I kept of my progress over the 2 weeks.
 
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting TODAY, I&#39;m taking part in a 2 week Info Product Challenge. <br><br>Over the next 14 days I&#39;ll be developing an e-book tentatively titled: <br><br>&quot;Untitled CSS Grid E-Book&quot;<br><br>üëáüèΩ Follow Along üëáüèΩ <a href="https://t.co/P3nVgUQ9ul">https://t.co/P3nVgUQ9ul</a></p>&mdash; Jack Harner üöÄ (@JackHarner) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackHarner/status/1302076806955069440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

## Missed The Deadline

I had originally planned to launch on Friday, the 14th day of the challenge. However it was Wednesday and I knew the book wasn't going to be ready. I pushed my launch back to Monday in order to give myself the weekend to _really_ get everything in a place where I felt comfortable taking people's money. 

I was disappointed with myself, but a few days late is better than not launching at all. 

## Things I Would Do Different

Just thinking back on everything, here are a few things I would change about the experience.

1. There were several days where life happened, and I made 0 progress on the book. I tried not to beat myself up about it, but if I had done at least 1 or 2 things on those days anyway, I probably would've launched on time. 
2. Build more hype around the product, but as my audience grows that will get easier. 
3. Have a better plan of what needs done with specific micro (daily) deadlines. Keep the train moving.

## Overall, I'm Happy.

At the end of the day, I didn't really expect anyone to buy it, and now that people have, I'm blown away! It was nice to finally finish something and I feel like having that self imposed deadline was really helpful in pushing the project forward. Most of my work these days have been pretty free-form so it was nice having some structure.
