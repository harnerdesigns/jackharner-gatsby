CSS Grid is an insanely powerful new technology for the web. It's not really new, but a lot of people don't really understand fully how to use it. 

I wrote The Grid Gospel as part of the [#2WeekProduct](https://twitter.com/hashtag/2WeekProduct?src=hashtag_click) challenge on Twitter. A handful of other people were inspired by this tweet: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My advice to first-time info product creators:<br><br>1. Start with a very small product.<br><br>2. Choose a topic you know well that will almost write itself. Avoid doing research.<br><br>3. Timebox production to 2 weeks.<br><br>4. Charge $10.<br><br>5. Promote it!<br><br>All the lessons are in #5. Best of luck!</p>&mdash; Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1287210142459547648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2020</a></blockquote>
