At the time, I was working as an intern and had access to a Mac Pro with OS X (<a href=\"/uses\">I mainly use Linux now</a>, but had never owned a Mac before). I figured I was spending enough time staring at the OS X desktop that I should try and make it entirely out of CSS.</p>\n<p>I cracked open <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jackharner\">CodePen</a> and got to work.</p>\n<h2>All Done, Time To Publish</h2>\n<p>After putting the finishing touches on all the details. I hit save, took it off private, and bolted to Twitter to share my new masterpiece. I was super proud. The menus were all pixel perfect, the desktop icons could be multi selected, the dock bounced it's classic bounce.</p>\n<h2>Straight To The Top!</h2>\n<p>I tagged @codepen on Twitter in hopes that they might retweet me, but they actually picked my Pen to be featured on the Front Page of CodePen! I was shocked and honored. I worked hard and now I was being recognized for it. As of writing it still has almost 40 Thousand Views. It's probably my most viewed piece of work to date and I still love looking back at it and clicking the icons and flipping through the menus.</p>","wordCount":{"words":227},"frontmatter":{"title":"OS X Recreation","description":"Built From Scratch CSS","color":"#7D7D7D","date":"June 30, 2020","tags":["HTML","CSS","CodePen","Animation"],"images":null,"logo":{"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/1aae60623be407a317dd79e2a953599d/osx-logo.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/osx-recreation/","collection":"portfolio","externalLink":"https://codepen.io/jackharner/full/jPmKGe","externalLinkLabel":"View On CodePen Â»"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/portfolio/osx-recreation/","related":[{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/bleeding-coffee/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"rgb(75, 44, 32)","title":"Bleeding Coffee","description":"WordPress Affiliate Blog","tags":["WordPress","PHP"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/3fbc751b394d59490fc336cb8973e8c5/BleedingCoffee-logo-white.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/shoolu-returns-portal/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#0fb681","title":"Shoolu Returns Portal","description":"Returns As Simple As Possible","tags":["E-Commerce","HTML","CSS"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/20ed27871795831b373cdedc681abde9/shoolu-logo.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/strich-customs/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#fe5900","title":"Strich Customs","description":"WooCommerce Store","tags":["E-Commerce","WordPress"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/8224e7e24ad9df6ba4796a14b2c762e1/strich-logo.png"}}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"]}
