At the time, I was working as an intern and had access to a Mac Pro with OS X (<a href=\"/uses\">I mainly use Linux now</a>, but had never owned a Mac before). I figured I was spending enough time staring at the OS X desktop that I should try and make it entirely out of CSS.</p>\n<p>I cracked open <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jackharner\">CodePen</a> and got to work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-done-time-to-publish\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#all-done-time-to-publish\" aria-label=\"all done time to publish permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>All Done, Time To Publish</h2>\n<p>After putting the finishing touches on all the details. I hit save, took it off private, and bolted to Twitter to share my new masterpiece. I was super proud. The menus were all pixel perfect, the desktop icons could be multi selected, the dock bounced it's classic bounce.</p>\n<h2 id=\"straight-to-the-top\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#straight-to-the-top\" aria-label=\"straight to the top permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Straight To The Top!</h2>\n<p>I tagged @codepen on Twitter in hopes that they might retweet me, but they actually picked my Pen to be featured on the Front Page of CodePen! I was shocked and honored. I worked hard and now I was being recognized for it. As of writing it still has almost 40 Thousand Views. It's probably my most viewed piece of work to date and I still love looking back at it and clicking the icons and flipping through the menus.</p>","wordCount":{"words":227},"frontmatter":{"title":"OS X Recreation","description":"Built From Scratch CSS","color":"#7D7D7D","date":"June 30, 2020","tags":["HTML","CSS","CodePen","Animation"],"images":null,"logo":{"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/1aae60623be407a317dd79e2a953599d/osx-logo.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/osx-recreation/","collection":"portfolio","externalLink":"https://codepen.io/jackharner/full/jPmKGe","externalLinkLabel":"View On CodePen Â»","unlisted":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/portfolio/osx-recreation/","related":[{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/shoolu-returns-portal/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#0fb681","title":"Shoolu Returns Portal","description":"Returns As Simple As Possible","tags":["E-Commerce","HTML","CSS"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/20ed27871795831b373cdedc681abde9/shoolu-logo.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/dickeys-dugout/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#2ba99c","title":"Dickey's Dugout","description":"Custom Shopify Theme","tags":["Shopify","E-Commerce"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/971997992170f47cff225a86715163f2/Dickeys-dugout-logo-white.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/dreamclub-united/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#222","title":"Dreamclub United","description":"LA Non Profit","tags":["E-Commerce","WordPress","Non Profit"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/b274658326547f38d3b542a9e616168a/Dream-Club-Logo.png"}}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
