At the time, I was working as an intern and had access to a Mac Pro with OS X (<a href=\"/uses\">I mainly use Linux now</a>, but had never owned a Mac before). I figured I was spending enough time staring at the OS X desktop that I should try and make it entirely out of CSS.</p>\n<p>I cracked open <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jackharner\">CodePen</a> and got to work.</p>\n<h2>All Done, Time To Publish</h2>\n<p>After putting the finishing touches on all the details. I hit save, took it off private, and bolted to Twitter to share my new masterpiece. I was super proud. The menus were all pixel perfect, the desktop icons could be multi selected, the dock bounced it's classic bounce.</p>\n<h2>Straight To The Top!</h2>\n<p>I tagged @codepen on Twitter in hopes that they might retweet me, but they actually picked my Pen to be featured on the Front Page of CodePen! I was shocked and honored. I worked hard and now I was being recognized for it. As of writing it still has almost 40 Thousand Views. It's probably my most viewed piece of work to date and I still love looking back at it and clicking the icons and flipping through the menus.</p>","wordCount":{"words":227},"frontmatter":{"title":"OS X Recreation","description":"Built From Scratch CSS","color":"#7D7D7D","date":"June 30, 2020","tags":["HTML","CSS","CodePen","Animation"],"images":null,"logo":{"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/1aae60623be407a317dd79e2a953599d/osx-logo.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/osx-recreation/","collection":"portfolio","externalLink":"https://codepen.io/jackharner/full/jPmKGe","externalLinkLabel":"View On CodePen Â»"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/portfolio/osx-recreation/","related":[{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/bottle-rocket-hot-sauce-co/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#e94939","title":"Bottle Rocket Hot Sauce","description":"Pre Sale Shopify Theme","tags":["Shopify","E-Commerce","Animation"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/307948d274e32231ac14bfce79e3d374/bottle-rocket-logo--red.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/dreamclub-united/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#222","title":"Dreamclub United","description":"LA Non Profit","tags":["E-Commerce","WordPress","Non Profit"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/b274658326547f38d3b542a9e616168a/Dream-Club-Logo.png"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/shoolu/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#02a974","title":"Shoolu","description":"E-Commerce Design & More","tags":["BigCommerce","E-Commerce"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/20ed27871795831b373cdedc681abde9/shoolu-logo.svg"}}}]}},
