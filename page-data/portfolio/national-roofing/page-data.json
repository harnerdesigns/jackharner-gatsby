All of the content was outdated, it wasn't easy to maintain at all, and they were in dire need of a full site rebuild.</p>\n<h2>The Solution:</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><center>Scrap Everything and Start Over.</center></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Process</h2>\n<p>Over the duration of the project, I worked with several key people in the company to ensure the site was going to meet the needs of everyone who had a say. I started with a rough mockup of the design, in order to quickly get a plan locked into place.</p>\n<p>Once the design was approved, I started working on both the base theme code as well as the illustration that I was going to eventually animate for the homepage.</p>\n<h2>The Illustration</h2>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1200px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 102%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"National Roofing is Coming Home Illustration\"\n        title=\"National Roofing is Coming Home Illustration\"\n        src=\"/static/8a3fdecb975363b3cf28cc3636cd9725/c1b63/national-roofing-illustration.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8a3fdecb975363b3cf28cc3636cd9725/5a46d/national-roofing-illustration.png 300w,\n/static/8a3fdecb975363b3cf28cc3636cd9725/0a47e/national-roofing-illustration.png 600w,\n/static/8a3fdecb975363b3cf28cc3636cd9725/c1b63/national-roofing-illustration.png 1200w,\n/static/8a3fdecb975363b3cf28cc3636cd9725/5b795/national-roofing-illustration.png 1455w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>National Roofing was in the process of bringing their years of commercial roofing experience to the residential market. I designed an illustration for animation of a crane slamming a roof onto a house.</p>\n<p>The house is in the style of a traditional New Mexico adobe house, and when the roof lands on the house, the illustration switches from black and white to color. Check it out on <a href=\"https://nationalroofing.com\">NationalRoofing.com</a></p>\n<h2>Built On WordPress</h2>\n<p>They wanted an easy way to add and update content as the site grew. I built out custom post types for their different Services, Projects, Testimonies &#x26; more. Their main complaint about their old site was all the work required to update the content. With WordPress, updating anything on the site is as easy as posting to Facebook.</p>\n<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>\n<p>I knew that they were going to have me continue updating the site, so I set up their repo with a GitHub Action that updates the theme on their site <a href=\"/blog/tags/automation/\">automatically</a>.</p>","wordCount":{"words":308},"frontmatter":{"title":"National Roofing","description":"Custom WordPress Site","color":"#0087ce","date":"December 13, 2022","tags":["WordPress","Animation","React","Automation"],"images":[{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/national-roofing-homepage-2c3d8ce4fc72d452958c1ece5de1c30c.png","height":4036,"width":1855}}},{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/national-roofing-homepage-mobile-25c699b8ec6cadf866ba491fefb6ed8f.png","height":1826,"width":900}}},{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/national-roofing-services-6ad60293118e39aeb9eb788a801227cc.png","height":2033,"width":1855}}},{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/national-roofing-portfolio-b2d3c6b596b39001561edf3ecb9b49ff.png","height":4093,"width":1855}}}],"logo":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/c5f673dc8197b2598e61d73a274086e4/national-roofing-logo.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/national-roofing/","collection":"portfolio","externalLink":"https://nationalroofing.com","externalLinkLabel":"Check It Out Â»"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/portfolio/national-roofing/","related":[{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/material-color/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#efefef","title":"Material Color Palette","description":"Chrome & Firefox Extension","tags":["HTML","CSS","Material Design"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/b75df55c5164d0412b04a2b15ba0374b/material-color-logo-text.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/shoolu-returns-portal/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#0fb681","title":"Shoolu Returns Portal","description":"Returns As Simple As Possible","tags":["E-Commerce","HTML","CSS"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/20ed27871795831b373cdedc681abde9/shoolu-logo.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/strich-customs/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#fe5900","title":"Strich Customs","description":"WooCommerce Store","tags":["E-Commerce","WordPress"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/8224e7e24ad9df6ba4796a14b2c762e1/strich-logo.png"}}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"]}
