Since this project wasn't even off the ground yet, I decided to shutter it. Ironically, I started using <a href=\"https://hypefury.com/?via=jackharner\">HypeFury</a> shortly after to manage my tweet schedule. It's been pretty great so far. Check it out with my <a href=\"https://hypefury.com/?via=jackharner\">HypeFury affiliate link</a> if you're interested in supercharging your Twitter (X) account</p>\n<h2>The History of Simple Tweets</h2>\n<p>Simple Tweets was an idea I had a while back.

A Dam of sorts between Twitter and my brain, only letting a little trickle through at a time.</p>\n<p>You login with Twitter, select how many times per day you want to tweet, and start brain dumping. That's it.</p>\n<h2>Build Log</h2>\n<p>Slowly but surely making progress.
