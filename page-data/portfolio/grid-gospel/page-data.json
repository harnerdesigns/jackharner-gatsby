It's not really new, but a lot of people don't really understand fully how to use it. </p>\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"https://gridgospel.com\">The Grid Gospel</a> as part of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/2WeekProduct?src=hashtag_click\">#2WeekProduct</a> challenge on Twitter. A handful of other people were inspired by this tweet: </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My advice to first-time info product creators:<br><br>1. Start with a very small product.<br><br>2. Choose a topic you know well that will almost write itself. Avoid doing research.<br><br>3. Timebox production to 2 weeks.<br><br>4. Charge $10.<br><br>5. Promote it!<br><br>All the lessons are in #5. Best of luck!</p>&mdash; Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1287210142459547648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 26, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<p>Basically it was a push to create some sort of informational product that you can sell, only give yourself 2 weeks to finish it, and sell it for $10. Seemed like a pretty decent challenge to partake in. </p>\n<p>Given the limited time span I had to pick something I was already pretty knowledgeable about, so I knew it was going to be based around CSS. I'd had the idea of doing a book about CSS Grid for a while and then I got invited to do the #2WeekProduct challenge I figured that was a pretty great time to do it. </p>\n<p>It started life as the \"Untitled CSS Grid Ebook\" before I settled on \"The Grid Gospel\". I didn't want to get too hung up on the name and the branding before I'd even wrote the thing, but I still wanted to tweet about it to build hype. </p>\n<p>Here's the Twitter thread I kept of my progress over the 2 weeks.</p>\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Starting TODAY, I&#39;m taking part in a 2 week Info Product Challenge. <br><br>Over the next 14 days I&#39;ll be developing an e-book tentatively titled: <br><br>&quot;Untitled CSS Grid E-Book&quot;<br><br>üëáüèΩ Follow Along üëáüèΩ <a href=\"https://t.co/P3nVgUQ9ul\">https://t.co/P3nVgUQ9ul</a></p>&mdash; Jack Harner üöÄ (@JackHarner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackHarner/status/1302076806955069440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 5, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<h2>Missed The Deadline</h2>\n<p>I had originally planned to launch on Friday, the 14th day of the challenge. However it was Wednesday and I knew the book wasn't going to be ready. I pushed my launch back to Monday in order to give myself the weekend to <em>really</em> get everything in a place where I felt comfortable taking people's money. </p>\n<p>I was disappointed with myself, but a few days late is better than not launching at all. </p>\n<h2>Things I Would Do Different</h2>\n<p>Just thinking back on everything, here are a few things I would change about the experience.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There were several days where life happened, and I made 0 progress on the book. I tried not to beat myself up about it, but if I had done at least 1 or 2 things on those days anyway, I probably would've launched on time. </li>\n<li>Build more hype around the product, but as my audience grows that will get easier. </li>\n<li>Have a better plan of what needs done with specific micro (daily) deadlines. Keep the train moving.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Overall, I'm Happy.</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, I didn't really expect anyone to buy it, and now that people have, I'm blown away! It was nice to finally finish something and I feel like having that self imposed deadline was really helpful in pushing the project forward. Most of my work these days have been pretty free-form so it was nice having some structure. </p>","wordCount":{"words":451},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Grid Gospel","description":"An Intro To CSS Grid","color":"#f6e048","date":"September 24, 2020","tags":["CSS","Writing"],"images":[{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"src":"/static/5e80426b1189c63b37d1be02820dc131/14b42/The-Grid-Gospel-cover-image.jpg"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"src":"/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/14b42/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.jpg"}}}],"logo":{"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/afc705320c79abd2e0753baa5c0e17cd/Grid-Gospel-Text-Logo.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/grid-gospel/","collection":"portfolio","externalLink":"https://gridgospel.com","externalLinkLabel":"Check It Out ¬ª"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/portfolio/grid-gospel/","related":[{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/dreamclub-united/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#222","title":"Dreamclub United","description":"LA Non Profit","tags":["HTML","WordPress","Non Profit"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/b274658326547f38d3b542a9e616168a/Dream-Club-Logo.png"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/osx-recreation/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#7D7D7D","title":"OS X Recreation","description":"Built From Scratch CSS","tags":["HTML","CSS","CodePen","Animation"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/1aae60623be407a317dd79e2a953599d/osx-logo.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/shoe-fitters/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#0c5644","title":"Shoe Fitters","description":"WordPress Site","tags":["WordPress","HTML","PHP"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/45769e4815bb07a8df999acae6aced31/shoefitters-logo.svg"}}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"]}
