It's not really new, but a lot of people don't really understand fully how to use it.</p>\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"https://gridgospel.com\">The Grid Gospel</a> as part of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/2WeekProduct?src=hashtag_click\">#2WeekProduct</a> challenge on BlueSky. A handful of other people were inspired by this tweet:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My advice to first-time info product creators:<br><br>1. Start with a very small product.<br><br>2. Choose a topic you know well that will almost write itself. Avoid doing research.<br><br>3. Timebox production to 2 weeks.<br><br>4. Charge $10.<br><br>5. Promote it!<br><br>All the lessons are in #5. Best of luck!</p>&mdash; Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1287210142459547648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 26, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<p>Basically it was a push to create some sort of informational product that you can sell, only give yourself 2 weeks to finish it, and sell it for $10. Seemed like a pretty decent challenge to partake in.</p>\n<p>Given the limited time span I had to pick something I was already pretty knowledgeable about, so I knew it was going to be based around CSS. I'd had the idea of doing a book about CSS Grid for a while and then I got invited to do the #2WeekProduct challenge I figured that was a pretty great time to do it.</p>\n<p>It started life as the \"Untitled CSS Grid Ebook\" before I settled on \"The Grid Gospel\". I didn't want to get too hung up on the name and the branding before I'd even wrote the thing, but I still wanted to tweet about it to build hype.</p>\n<p>Here's the BlueSky thread I kept of my progress over the 2 weeks.</p>\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Starting TODAY, I&#39;m taking part in a 2 week Info Product Challenge. <br><br>Over the next 14 days I&#39;ll be developing an e-book tentatively titled: <br><br>&quot;Untitled CSS Grid E-Book&quot;<br><br>üëáüèΩ Follow Along üëáüèΩ <a href=\"https://t.co/P3nVgUQ9ul\">https://t.co/P3nVgUQ9ul</a></p>&mdash; Jack Harner üöÄ (@JackHarner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackHarner/status/1302076806955069440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 5, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"missed-the-deadline\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#missed-the-deadline\" aria-label=\"missed the deadline permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Missed The Deadline</h2>\n<p>I had originally planned to launch on Friday, the 14th day of the challenge. However it was Wednesday and I knew the book wasn't going to be ready. I pushed my launch back to Monday in order to give myself the weekend to <em>really</em> get everything in a place where I felt comfortable taking people's money.</p>\n<p>I was disappointed with myself, but a few days late is better than not launching at all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"things-i-would-do-different\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#things-i-would-do-different\" aria-label=\"things i would do different permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Things I Would Do Different</h2>\n<p>Just thinking back on everything, here are a few things I would change about the experience.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There were several days where life happened, and I made 0 progress on the book. I tried not to beat myself up about it, but if I had done at least 1 or 2 things on those days anyway, I probably would've launched on time.</li>\n<li>Build more hype around the product, but as my audience grows that will get easier.</li>\n<li>Have a better plan of what needs done with specific micro (daily) deadlines. Keep the train moving.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"overall-im-happy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#overall-im-happy\" aria-label=\"overall im happy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Overall, I'm Happy.</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, I didn't really expect anyone to buy it, and now that people have, I'm blown away! It was nice to finally finish something and I feel like having that self imposed deadline was really helpful in pushing the project forward. Most of my work these days have been pretty free-form so it was nice having some structure.</p>","wordCount":{"words":451},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Grid Gospel","description":"An Intro To CSS Grid","color":"#f6e048","date":"September 24, 2020","tags":["CSS","Writing"],"images":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8e848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5e80426b1189c63b37d1be02820dc131/558bc/The-Grid-Gospel-cover-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5e80426b1189c63b37d1be02820dc131/a73a1/The-Grid-Gospel-cover-image.jpg 200w,\n/static/5e80426b1189c63b37d1be02820dc131/309a6/The-Grid-Gospel-cover-image.jpg 400w,\n/static/5e80426b1189c63b37d1be02820dc131/558bc/The-Grid-Gospel-cover-image.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5e80426b1189c63b37d1be02820dc131/8a265/The-Grid-Gospel-cover-image.webp 200w,\n/static/5e80426b1189c63b37d1be02820dc131/c8e17/The-Grid-Gospel-cover-image.webp 400w,\n/static/5e80426b1189c63b37d1be02820dc131/886ab/The-Grid-Gospel-cover-image.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":394}}},{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/47a0f/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/d6f0f/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.jpg 200w,\n/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/9e9ed/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.jpg 400w,\n/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/47a0f/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.jpg 800w,\n/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/41580/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/daff0/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.webp 200w,\n/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/16814/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.webp 400w,\n/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/44764/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.webp 800w,\n/static/3a774028b58126a3b705532d1070dfc2/0c322/The-Grid-Gospel-Cover--final.webp 1600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":1035}}}],"logo":{"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/afc705320c79abd2e0753baa5c0e17cd/Grid-Gospel-Text-Logo.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/grid-gospel/","collection":"portfolio","externalLink":"https://gridgospel.com","externalLinkLabel":"Check It Out ¬ª","unlisted":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/portfolio/grid-gospel/","related":[{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/dickeys-dugout/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#2ba99c","title":"Dickey's Dugout","description":"Custom Shopify Theme","tags":["Shopify","E-Commerce"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/971997992170f47cff225a86715163f2/Dickeys-dugout-logo-white.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/easier-golfing/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#333","title":"Easier Golfing","description":"Custom Shopify Theme","tags":["Shopify","E-Commerce"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/ecf80aa4393d49a7a546e5764a4f2ac2/easier-golfing-logo.webp"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/shoolu-product-api/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#0fb681","title":"Shoolu Product API","description":"Filling Gaps In BigCommerce","tags":["PHP","AJAX","BigCommerce","E-Commerce"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/20ed27871795831b373cdedc681abde9/shoolu-logo.svg"}}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}
