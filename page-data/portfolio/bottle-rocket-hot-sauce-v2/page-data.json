We were still rocking the <a href=\"/portfolio/bottle-rocket-hot-sauce-co/\">Pre-Sale Landing Page</a> we launched with. It served it's purpose, and it served it well. However Bottle Rocket Hot Sauce was looking to expand both it's catalog, and it's reach as a company. Here's a little rundown of some of the features:</p>\n<h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Floating Checkout Button</h2>\n<p>As you scroll down the catalog on the front page, the Check Out button is always right there for quick and easy access to the checkout flow. The cart count live updates as you update your cart throughout the site.</p>\n<div id=\"scroll-down\"><FontAwesomeIcon icon=\"fa-caret-down\"></FontAwesomeIcon></div>\n<h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ AJAX Order Form</h2>\n<p>The landing page form reflects the cart values and syncs in real time with the Shopify Storefront API.  This keeps the customer aware of what's in their cart at any given time.</p>\n<p>Like with the Pre-Sale Landing Page, as you add things to your cart, the bottles start to shake. Hit Checkout and it's 3.. 2.. 1.. LIFT OFF! A fun little bit of animation utilizing GSAP we carried over into v2. Go check out the site to see it live!</p>\n<h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ One Of Each Buttons</h2>\n<p>Since all of the sauces are sold a la carte, we needed an easy way for someone to get \"One of everything\". A similar setup was built into v1, but it needed to be adapted to work with multiple sections on the page.</p>\n<h2>4Ô∏è‚É£ Multiple Products and Variations</h2>\n<p>Keep an eye out for Bottle Rocket Hot Sauce Co. merch coming very soon. One of the primary reasons for redoing the site was to be able to support multiple products. Right now we just have the sauces and the stickers but we should have shirts and pins and more live soon! Make sure to follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BottleRocketHSC\">@BottleRocketHSC</a> on Twitter for updates.</p>\n<h2>Go Buy Some Sauce üöÄ</h2>\n<p>Overall I'm really excited with how v2 of the site came out, stoked it's finally launched, and can't wait for what's to come!</p>\n<p>Hit up <a href=\"https://bottlerocketsauce.com\">Bottle Rocket Hot Sauce</a> and tell them Jack sent you. I doubt it will get you anything, but it probably won't hurt, and will boost my ego a little bit. Win-Win-Win.</p>","wordCount":{"words":358},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bottle Rocket Hot Sauce v2","description":"SauceHub v2","color":"#e94939","date":"August 08, 2020","tags":["Shopify","E-Commerce","Animation"],"images":[{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/v2-mobile-on-desktop-7e4d8182182fe6063e216d832f0156ee.png","height":941,"width":1855}}},{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/v2-full-9db432f202c453eb67a17c4d5cf60a6f.png","height":7060,"width":1117}}}],"logo":{"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/307948d274e32231ac14bfce79e3d374/bottle-rocket-logo--red.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/bottle-rocket-hot-sauce-v2/","collection":"portfolio","externalLink":"https://bottlerocketsauce.com","externalLinkLabel":"Go Buy Some Sauce!!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/portfolio/bottle-rocket-hot-sauce-v2/","related":[{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/grid-gospel/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#f6e048","title":"The Grid Gospel","description":"An Intro To CSS Grid","tags":["CSS","Writing"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/afc705320c79abd2e0753baa5c0e17cd/Grid-Gospel-Text-Logo.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/osx-recreation/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#7D7D7D","title":"OS X Recreation","description":"Built From Scratch CSS","tags":["HTML","CSS","CodePen","Animation"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/1aae60623be407a317dd79e2a953599d/osx-logo.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/strich-customs/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#fe5900","title":"Strich Customs","description":"WooCommerce Store","tags":["E-Commerce","WordPress"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/8224e7e24ad9df6ba4796a14b2c762e1/strich-logo.png"}}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"]}
