Most of the people coming to this page are looking to either return or exchange. Depending on the selected options, the form guides the user through the returns process, or completes a form that generates a ticket in Shoolu's support system so their customer service can resolve the issues and keep the customer happy.</p>\n<h3>Self Service Is King.</h3>\n<p>People hate contacting companies and potentially having to sit on hold for hours on end. Creating this portal allowed more returns to get processed with less calls and less tickets opened, saving both the customer time and the business money.</p>","wordCount":{"words":127},"frontmatter":{"title":"Shoolu Returns Portal","description":"Returns As Simple As Possible","color":"#0fb681","date":"January 06, 2020","tags":["E-Commerce","HTML","CSS"],"images":[{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/shoolu-returns-full-page-a88cd6be47f6b1ad67c0e657ac7f3862.png"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/shoolu-returns-exchange-form-82f58ccb9acd27338e0e81f73130c357.png"}}}],"logo":{"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/20ed27871795831b373cdedc681abde9/shoolu-logo.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/shoolu-returns-portal/","collection":"portfolio","externalLink":"https://returns.shoolu.com","externalLinkLabel":"See The Portal"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/portfolio/shoolu-returns-portal/","related":[{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/recent-posts-markdown-wordpress-plugin/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#4e2ea1","title":"Recent Posts Markdown Generator","description":"WordPress Plugin","tags":["WordPress","PHP","Automation"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/2f7e57fa474ada267482f5277ac7bf06/icon-line.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/osx-recreation/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#7D7D7D","title":"OS X Recreation","description":"Built From Scratch CSS","tags":["HTML","CSS","CodePen","Animation"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/1aae60623be407a317dd79e2a953599d/osx-logo.svg"}}},{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/dickeys-dugout/","collection":"portfolio","published":true},"frontmatter":{"color":"#2ba99c","title":"Dickey's Dugout","description":"Custom Shopify Theme","tags":["Shopify","E-Commerce"],"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/971997992170f47cff225a86715163f2/Dickeys-dugout-logo-white.svg"}}}]}},
