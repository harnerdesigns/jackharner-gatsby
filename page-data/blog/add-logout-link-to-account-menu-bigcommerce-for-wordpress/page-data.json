The \"SubNav\" as they've called it is populated in <code>bigcommerce-for-wordpress/src/BigCommerce/Accounts/Sub_Nav.php</code>. It uses <code>get_option</code> to pull the stored Account, Orders, &#x26; Address pages and populates the <code>$links[]</code> array with the associated data.</p>\n<p>Easy.</p>\n<p>Just append the logout information to the <code>$links[]</code> array with <code>wp_logout_url()</code> and the logout link will appear in the my accounts page.</p>\n<p>And thus, my first <a href=\"https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/pull/150\">Pull Request</a> to the BC4WP repo was born.</p>\n<h2>Shot Down Like A High Schooler Before Prom</h2>\n<p>My PR was rejected citing that logging out of WordPress was \"Out of Scope\" of the BigCommerce for WordPress plugin. However, Jonathan of <a href=\"https://tri.be/\">Modern Tribe</a> (the plugin developers) pointed out that there is a filter already applied to the links generated so that Site Admins can add anything they wish to that list of links: <code>bigcommerce/account/subnav/links</code>.</p>\n<h2>So..? How Do You Do It?</h2>\n<p>If you're like me and <em>want</em> to add the logout link to the BigCommerce for WordPress Account Page Submenu, just add the following code to your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"php\"><pre class=\"language-php\"><code class=\"language-php\"><span class=\"token function\">add_filter</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'bigcommerce/account/subnav/links'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token variable\">$links</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n <span class=\"token variable\">$links</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n  <span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'url'</span>     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span>gt<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token function\">wp_logout_url</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'label'</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span>gt<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token function\">__</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'Logout'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'bigcommerce'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'current'</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span>gt<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token constant boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token variable\">$links</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>And that's it!
