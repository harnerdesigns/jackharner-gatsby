I got the Pi 4 Model B, the latest and greatest. It boasts the ability to replace your desktop computer, with two micro-HDMI outs as well as on-board wi-fi and 4 USBs. Seeing as a lot of stuff I do needs a lot of processing power, I doubt it will be replacing mine, but I'm excited to see what I can do with it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/769a478461bbe84d9a9ac61cf6cece3d/raspberry-pi.webp\" alt=\"Raspberry Pi 4B\"></p>\n<h2>PiHole - Block ALL THE ADS.. Sort of..</h2>\n<p>If you're not familiar, <a href=\"https://pi-hole.net/\">PiHole</a> is a lovely piece of software that can act as a network-wide ad-block for your entire house. Hypothetically super simple to set up: Install Raspberry Pi, Run a Bash Script, Set your router to use your Pi as the DNS server, and you're done. </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1200px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 51%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"PiHole Dashboard\"\n        title=\"PiHole Dashboard\"\n        src=\"/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/c1b63/pihole-dashboard.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/5a46d/pihole-dashboard.png 300w,\n/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/0a47e/pihole-dashboard.png 600w,\n/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/c1b63/pihole-dashboard.png 1200w,\n/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/d61c2/pihole-dashboard.png 1800w,\n/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/29114/pihole-dashboard.png 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>For me, it turned out not as simple. I use the stock Router/Modem Combo provided to me by Comcast. Turns out, they don't allow you to set custom DNS servers for the network. Great. So now I have to go around and configure each device manually to use the Pi as it's DNS server to get it to work. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>It's Always DNS.</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've been meaning to buy my own router/modem for a while now, and this might be what finally pushes me over the edge. </p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I've got a couple different <a href=\"https://twitter.com/git_shit\">Twitter bots</a> and such running on different servers that I might try to consolidate to the Pi.

It hovers right around 66°C. with just PiHole running, but I'm sure that will jump up once I start using it for other things.</li>\n<li>I also had an idea for a lightweight web app that I could host on the Pi and use QR codes to track how often I water my plants. This one's probably way down the line, but could be a cool open source project to work on. </li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"After wanting one for some time, I finally caved and bought a Raspberry Pi.
