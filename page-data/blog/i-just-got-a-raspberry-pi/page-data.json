I got the Pi 4 Model B, the latest and greatest. It boasts the ability to replace your desktop computer, with two micro-HDMI outs as well as on-board wi-fi and 4 USBs. Seeing as a lot of stuff I do needs a lot of processing power, I doubt it will be replacing mine, but I'm excited to see what I can do with it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/769a478461bbe84d9a9ac61cf6cece3d/raspberry-pi.webp\" alt=\"Raspberry Pi 4B\"></p>\n<h2>PiHole - Block ALL THE ADS.. Sort of..</h2>\n<p>If you're not familiar, <a href=\"https://pi-hole.net/\">PiHole</a> is a lovely piece of software that can act as a network-wide ad-block for your entire house. Hypothetically super simple to set up: Install Raspberry Pi, Run a Bash Script, Set your router to use your Pi as the DNS server, and you're done.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1200px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 51%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"PiHole Dashboard\"\n        title=\"PiHole Dashboard\"\n        src=\"/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/c1b63/pihole-dashboard.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/5a46d/pihole-dashboard.png 300w,\n/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/0a47e/pihole-dashboard.png 600w,\n/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/c1b63/pihole-dashboard.png 1200w,\n/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/d61c2/pihole-dashboard.png 1800w,\n/static/c1ab75e9b134942067ffa3dbc7283707/29114/pihole-dashboard.png 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>For me, it turned out not as simple. I use the stock Router/Modem Combo provided to me by Comcast. Turns out, they don't allow you to set custom DNS servers for the network. Great. So now I have to go around and configure each device manually to use the Pi as it's DNS server to get it to work.</p>\n<p>{{{vert}}}</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>It's Always DNS.</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've been meaning to buy my own router/modem for a while now, and this might be what finally pushes me over the edge.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I've got a couple different <a href=\"https://twitter.com/git_shit\">Twitter bots</a> and such running on different servers that I might try to consolidate to the Pi.

It hovers right around 66°C. with just PiHole running, but I'm sure that will jump up once I start using it for other things.</li>\n<li>I also had an idea for a lightweight web app that I could host on the Pi and use QR codes to track how often I water my plants.
