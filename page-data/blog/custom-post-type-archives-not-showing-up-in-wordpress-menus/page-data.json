I tore my hair out for a good while before finding the answer. For some reason, most of my custom post types were showing up just fine, but some weren't. The answer is surprisingly simple and shouldn't have taken me as long to figure out as it did.</p>\n<h2>Make Sure The Archive Is Turned On</h2>\nYou can't add a CPT Archive to a menu if that archive doesn't exist. Make sure in your functions.php file that you include the following code when creating the post type:\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"php\"><pre class=\"language-php\"><code class=\"language-php\"><span class=\"token function\">register_post_type</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'example'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> \n    <span class=\"token keyword\">array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'has_archive'</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span>gt<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token constant boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> \n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>other args<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Check Under The \"View All\" Tab</h2>\nOnce you made sure that the archive is on, check under the View All tab for the custom post type. It should just be the plural name of your custom post type, but it could be different depending on the settings in your register_post_type() function.\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-433 size-full\" src=\"https://harnerdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/View-All-Tab.png\" alt=\"Make Sure To Check The View All Tab\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\">\n<h2>Check The Screen Options</h2>\nIf your custom post type isn't showing up at all on the Menu page, check the Screen Options. For some reason, new CPTs can possibly be unchecked and thus, not show up at all on the Menu page. Make sure everything is checked in the box and you should be all set!\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-434 size-full\" src=\"https://harnerdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Options.png\" alt=\"Check The Screen Options And Make Sure Your Custom Post Type Is Checked\" width=\"600\" height=\"204\">\n<h2>Conclusion.
