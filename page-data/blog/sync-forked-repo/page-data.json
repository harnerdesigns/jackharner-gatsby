Good for you. That's the beauty of Open Source, even just fixing typos in the documentation makes a difference. Today I'm going to walk you through keeping your copy of a repo up to date with changes pushed to the original repo.</p>\n<p>This tutorial assumes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have a basic understanding of git</li>\n<li>You have a forked repo</li>\n<li>The original repo has changes that you want in your forked repo</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting Up The Remote</h2>\n<p>The first thing you want to do is add the Original Repo as a remote of your Forked Repo. From the command line you want to move into your project directory and add the Original Repo's clone URL as the <code class=\"language-text\">upstream</code> remote.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"command-line-prompt\"><span data-user=jack data-host=localhost></span><span data-user=jack data-host=localhost></span></span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>project_name<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> remote <span class=\"token function\">add</span> upstream <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>original_repo_url<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The Repo URL can be found on the Repo page on Github.

You can usually just leave the default and just save with <code class=\"language-text\">CTRL + X</code>. Git finishes up the merge commit, and your Local Repo is now up to date with the Original.</p>\n<h2>Seal The Deal</h2>\n<p>Finish off your changes by pushing them back up to your Forked Repo's <code class=\"language-text\">origin</code> remote that you have write access to.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"command-line-prompt\"><span data-user=jack data-host=localhost></span></span><span class=\"token function\">git</span> push origin master</code></pre></div>\n<p>Ta da! You just refreshed your forked repo. Make, test, commit and push your changes and you'll be all set to create a pull request back to the Original Repo. You're ready to start changing the world of Open Source Software one pull request at a time!</p>","excerpt":"So, you want to make some changes to an Open Source Repo? Good for you.
