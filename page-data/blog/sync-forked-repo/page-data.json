That's the beauty of Open Source, even just fixing typos in the documentation makes a difference. Today I'm going to walk you through keeping your copy of a repo up to date with changes pushed to the original repo.</p>\n<p>This tutorial assumes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have a basic understanding of git</li>\n<li>You have a forked repo</li>\n<li>The original repo has changes that you want in your forked repo</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting Up The Remote</h2>\n<p>The first thing you want to do is add the Original Repo as a remote of your Forked Repo. From the command line you want to move into your project directory and add the Original Repo's clone URL as the <code class=\"language-text\">upstream</code> remote.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"command-line-prompt\"><span data-user=jack data-host=localhost></span><span data-user=jack data-host=localhost></span></span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>project_name<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> remote <span class=\"token function\">add</span> upstream <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>original_repo_url<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The Repo URL can be found on the Repo page on Github.

It essentially lets you see what everyone else has done to the code without making any changes to yours. You should see it pull down a bunch of different branches, tags, and some file changes.</p>\n<p>To apply the new changes to your repo make sure you're on the branch you want to pull in (in our case <code class=\"language-text\">master</code>):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"command-line-prompt\"><span data-user=jack data-host=localhost></span></span><span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout master</code></pre></div>\n<p>and then pull the matching branch from the <code class=\"language-text\">upstream</code> remote:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"command-line-prompt\"><span data-user=jack data-host=localhost></span></span><span class=\"token function\">git</span> pull upstream master</code></pre></div>\n<p>It will asks you for a message for the merge commit. You can usually just leave the default and just save with <code class=\"language-text\">CTRL + X</code>. Git finishes up the merge commit, and your Local Repo is now up to date with the Original.</p>\n<h2>Seal The Deal</h2>\n<p>Finish off your changes by pushing them back up to your Forked Repo's <code class=\"language-text\">origin</code> remote that you have write access to.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"command-line-prompt\"><span data-user=jack data-host=localhost></span></span><span class=\"token function\">git</span> push origin master</code></pre></div>\n<p>Ta da! You just refreshed your forked repo. Make, test, commit and push your changes and you'll be all set to create a pull request back to the Original Repo. You're ready to start changing the world of Open Source Software one pull request at a time!</p>","excerpt":"So, you want to make some changes to an Open Source Repo? Good for you.
