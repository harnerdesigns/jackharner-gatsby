I've, thankfully, been working the whole time through the pandemic, both on some client work and my 9-5. I opened the project back up because I'm making a point to be more active on Twitter and that was the whole reason I started building Simple Tweets in the first place. </p>\n<p>Boot it up with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"command-line-prompt\"><span data-user=jack data-host=localhost></span></span><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> run startBoth</code></pre></div>\n<p>which runs both the Frontend React code as well as the backend Node server. Everything loads fine, but I try to sign in with Twitter and it doesn't work. It just sits spinning on the Twitter oAuth page, waiting for my server to respond then after a minute, it kicks back an Error 500: Service Unavailable.</p>\n<p>I thought maybe it was a lingering Cookie issue, so I cleared all those out, but still no response on the login.</p>\n<p>I check the server logs and it comes back with \"Login Successful\" but never redirects the user to be logged in. </p>\n<p>I'm perplexed but tired, it's late so I just shut it down and go to bed. I'll revisit in a few days probably.</p>\n<h1>Day 12 : Wednesday, April 29th, 2020</h1>\n<h2>Better Late Than Never, Right?</h2>\n<p>I'm starting this build log off a little bit after I started the project (currently titled Simple Tweets, but probably going to change). I didn't really have the idea to write down the whole process till I was well into an MVP. Either way, better late than never, right? According to GitHub the very first commit was on April 17, 2020, so that makes this Day 12.</p>\n<p>My vision for Simple Tweets is a tool you can use to schedule tweets without thinking about it. You decide the max times it will tweet for you per day, whether you want it random or on a schedule, and then scheduling tweets is as simple as typing it out and hitting schedule. </p>\n<p>I'm not really sure if this is something Twitter users really <em>need</em> per se, but it's been a massive learning opportunity for me so far. For now, that's all I really care about. </p>\n<h2>Design To Prototype</h2>\n<p>The idea had initially popped into my head a while back (way back in February, now that I looked it up) for a \"minimalist tweeter\". I wanted something where I could just spam the tweet box without actually spamming Twitter. I threw together this mockup in Illustrator shortly after having the idea.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1200px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 80%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Simple Tweets First Mockup\"\n        title=\"Simple Tweets First Mockup\"\n        src=\"/static/e16682f5cd5c32de32c7c25b52135e35/c1b63/Tweet-Scheduler-mockup.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e16682f5cd5c32de32c7c25b52135e35/5a46d/Tweet-Scheduler-mockup.png 300w,\n/static/e16682f5cd5c32de32c7c25b52135e35/0a47e/Tweet-Scheduler-mockup.png 600w,\n/static/e16682f5cd5c32de32c7c25b52135e35/c1b63/Tweet-Scheduler-mockup.png 1200w,\n/static/e16682f5cd5c32de32c7c25b52135e35/21b4d/Tweet-Scheduler-mockup.png 1280w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Two months go by, and I finally decide to build the thing. I knew I wanted to build the thing with React, and I had dabbled with a project using a MongoDB, Express, React &#x26; Node (MERN) stack earlier so that's what I chose for this project. </p>\n<h2>Time To React</h2>\n<p>The first thing I threw together was the React frontend. Had a lot of fun just recreating the mockup but with code (honestly my favorite part of any project). I started off with the fixed sidebar, and the tweet box. Used state to set the Tweet character limit, track the tweet as you're typing and validate the current entry. </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">validateTweet</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">tweet</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> tweetCharCount <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> tweet<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token constant\">CURRENT</span> <span class=\"token constant\">IMAGE</span> <span class=\"token constant\">OF</span> <span class=\"token constant\">SIMPLE</span> <span class=\"token constant\">TWEETS</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>tweetCharCount <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>tweetCharCount <span class=\"token operator\">></span> tweetCharLimit<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Very simple for now, but essentially checks if the tweet length is greater than 0 and less than 280. After a few days of back and forth, I eventually settled on going with a minimal light theme instead of dark. I'll probably add a toggle for that down the line, but for now I don't really care. </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1200px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Simple Tweets Now\"\n        title=\"Simple Tweets Now\"\n        src=\"/static/283464ec872683937c1feb9b6d40de05/e5166/simple-tweets-now.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/283464ec872683937c1feb9b6d40de05/f93b5/simple-tweets-now.jpg 300w,\n/static/283464ec872683937c1feb9b6d40de05/b4294/simple-tweets-now.jpg 600w,\n/static/283464ec872683937c1feb9b6d40de05/e5166/simple-tweets-now.jpg 1200w,\n/static/283464ec872683937c1feb9b6d40de05/d9c39/simple-tweets-now.jpg 1800w,\n/static/283464ec872683937c1feb9b6d40de05/0a188/simple-tweets-now.jpg 1908w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<h2>oAuth Is Pretty Cool, Now That I Have A Better Grasp</h2>\n<p>Since the tool is entirely focused on Twitter, the only way my users can login is with Twitter. Makes Sense. That just meant I had to figure out oAuth. It's been a pretty big beast for me that I've yet to attempt to tackle, but now is the time. </p>\n<p>The backend is based around Express, and MongoDB. I'm using <a href=\"http://www.passportjs.org/\">Passport.js</a> for Authentication and the beautifully put together <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-twitter\">passport-twitter</a> package to handle the Authentication. </p>\n<p>One of the first big roadblocks I ran into was the fact that I had set up a virtual host so that <code class=\"language-text\">simple-tweets.local</code> would resolve to my <code class=\"language-text\">localhost:3000</code>, but I was having weird issues with the cookies being set to the wrong domain somewhere in the oAuth loop. Lots of googling and hair ripping later, I reset every path in the project to use <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1\">http://127.0.0.1</a> as well as in the Twitter Developer tools. Once we have it live on a server with a domain pointing to it, we shouldn't have this problem, but now I'll know what to look for. </p>\n<p>I'll contine to update this post as the project progresses. </p>","excerpt":"Day 99 : Saturday, July 26th, 2020 Long Time No Talk.
