It's fairly simple and straightforward.</p>\n<p>All you need to do is include a <code>%c</code> string before your log message and then pass your CSS as a parameter to the console.log( ) function. Like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">console.log(\"%c{{Log Message}}\", \"{{CSS}}\");\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example, this code runs on <a href=\"https://harnerdesigns.com\">my portfolio</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">console.log(\"%cHarner Designs\", \"color:#233E82; font-family:'Ubuntu'; display: block;font-weight:bold; font-size:48px; background:#fff;\");\n    console.log(\"%cLike to dig into the meaty bits of the website?\\nThanks for looking! Hit us up on Twitter @harnerdesigns!\", \"color:#222; font-family:'Ubuntu'; font-weight:100; font-size:24px; background:#fff;\");\n    console.log(\"%cDid you know you can style your console output?!\", \"color:#333; font-family:'Ubuntu'; font-weight:100; font-size:18px; background:#fff;\");\n    console.log(\"%cCheck our blog to learn how: https://harnerdesigns.com/blog/style-your-console-log-with-css/\", \"line-height: 3em; padding: 0.5em; text-align: center; border: 1px dotted #aaa; background:#fff; font-size: 14px;\");\n</code></pre>\n<p>and outputs like this to the console:</p>\n<img src=\"https://harnerdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/styled-console-update.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1025\" height=\"347\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1140\">\n<p>{{{vert}}}</p>\n<h2>Styling Multiple Strings In One Log</h2>\n<p>It's also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/13017382/10425698\">possible</a> to include multiple strings in one command and style them differently. Check it out:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">console.log(\"%cString1\" + \"%cString2\", \"{{CSS for String1}}\", \"{{CSS for String2}}\");\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Reusing Styles Across Log Messages</h2>\n<p>You can also store the CSS You want to apply to a variable and then pass that to multiple console.logs:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var consoleStyle = \"{{Reusable CSS}}\";\nconsole.log(\"%cString1\", consoleStyle);\nconsole.log(\"%cString2\", consoleStyle);\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Do you leave any little easter eggs in your console? Could you see a use case for this in your own projects? I'd love to know down in the comments! Show me some examples of cool things you've found in console messages.</p>","excerpt":"Photo by Glenn Carstens-Peters on Unsplash In Chrome and Firefox (>31) you can add CSS styles to your console.log() messages.
