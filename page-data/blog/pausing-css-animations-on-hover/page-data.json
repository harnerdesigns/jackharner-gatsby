One of the most frustrating things as a user is when you go to click on something, it moves, and you miss. Today I'm going to show you how to pause your CSS animations when someone goes to click on them.</p>\n<h2>The Animation</h2>\n<p>We'll start with one of my favorite simple animations, the Pulse:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@keyframes</span> pulse</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token selector\">0%</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">transform</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">scale</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>1<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token selector\">50%</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">transform</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">scale</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>1.1<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token selector\">100%</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">transform</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">scale</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>1<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Which looks like: <span class=\"box1\"></span></p>\n<p>I've used that animation many times to emphasize a discount, bring focus to the best deal on a Pricing page, or even just to make a beating heart.</p>\n<p>{{{vert}}}</p>\n<h2>Treat Your Users Like Stormtroopers - Avoid Moving Targets</h2>\n<p>If there are clickable things inside the thing you're animating, you don't want your users to have to click on moving targets. It's so frustrating to click and miss, let alone click, miss, and click on something else. Luckily, there's a really simple way to pause CSS Animations in CSS without JavaScript. The key to it all is the <code class=\"language-text\">animation-play-state</code> property. Let's see it in (SCSS) action:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"scss\"><pre class=\"language-scss\"><code class=\"language-scss\"><span class=\"token selector\">.box </span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">animation</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> pulse 3s infinite<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token selector\"><span class=\"token parent important\">&amp;</span>:hover </span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">animation-play-state</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> paused<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Which looks like: <span class=\"box2\"></span></p>\n<p>As you can see, it starts and stops the animation when you hover your mouse in and out of it.</p>\n<p>By setting the <code class=\"language-text\">animation-play-state</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">paused</code> on hover, the animation will pause, your click targets will stop moving, and your users will be happy. I had experimented with basically removing the animation on hover but that caused lots of jumps and skips. <code class=\"language-text\">animation-play-state</code> literally just pauses the animation and un-pauses when you stop hovering.</p>\n<p>Super simple way to have more user-friendly animations on your site.</p>","excerpt":"CSS Animations are an easy, lightweight way to add a little motion and excitement to a page.
