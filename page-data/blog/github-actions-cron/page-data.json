This is sweet if you're building a pseudo-static site with data that doesn't change all the time, but does change often enough to want to automate the build process. I initially implemented cron into my GitHub Actions to build my side project <a href=\"https://livemusicforecast.com\">Live Music Forecast</a> every 6 hours.</p>\n<h2>What is Cron?</h2>\n<p>Cron (aka Cron Jobs, Crontab) is a command line utility about as old as linux itself. Cron allows for the automatic running of code, scripts, &#x26; commands on a time based interval.</p>\n<h2>Defining the Cron Schedule</h2>\n<p>Cron takes in a string to determine which minutes, hours, days, &#x26; months to run your script on.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)\n│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)\n│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)\n│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)\n│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)\n│ │ │ │ │\n│ │ │ │ │\n│ │ │ │ │\n* * * * *</code></pre></div>\n<p>For example, <code class=\"language-text\">*/5 * * * *</code> will run your GitHub Action every 5 minutes of every day. This is most likely over kill and will probably run you into GitHub's Action time limits very quickly. Every 5 minutes is the fastest interval GitHub allows actions to be ran.</p>\n<p>Some more example cron schedules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">59 23 * * 6</code> will run at 11:59 PM on Saturday</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">0 12 1 * *</code> will run at 12 noon, on the 1st of every month</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">1 */6 * * *</code> runs at the first minute of every 6th hour. (12:01a, 6:01a, 12:01p, and 6:01p)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I highly recommend using a tool like <a href=\"https://crontab.guru\">crontab.guru</a> to make sure your schedule is set up properly. Debugging cron schedules is basically just publishing it and waiting for the scheduled time to come and go, so it can be annoying if you mess it up.</p>\n<h2>Scheduling your GitHub Action</h2>\n<p>In your action's configuration file, your schedule is defined as one of the workflow triggers under the <code class=\"language-text\">on:</code> attribute:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yml\"><pre class=\"language-yml\"><code class=\"language-yml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> GH Actions Cron Schedule\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">on</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">schedule</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">cron</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>  <span class=\"token string\">'1 */6 * * *'</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># rest of your action here...</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>If you need to, you can configure your action to run on multiple different schedules:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yml\"><pre class=\"language-yml\"><code class=\"language-yml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> GH Actions Multi<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>Cron\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">on</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">schedule</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">cron</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>  <span class=\"token string\">'1 */6 * * 0-4'</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># Run every 6hrs Sun-Thur</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">cron</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>  <span class=\"token string\">'1 */3 * * 5-6'</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># Run every 3hrs Fri-Sat</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># rest of your action here...</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>For the full list of things that can trigger your GitHub Workflows, check out the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule\">GitHub Docs</a>.</p>\n<h2>Heads Up, The Timing Isn't Going To Be Exact</h2>\n<p>GitHub Actions run in UTC time, so you'll need to adjust your cron schedule based on your timezone if you want it to run at a specific time.</p>\n<p>The other thing GitHub mentions is that your cron schedule is when the action will be queued to run. This doesn't mean your action will run at that exact time, depending on server availability.
