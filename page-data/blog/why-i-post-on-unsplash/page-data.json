The partnership looks like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They hire photographers from the Unsplash community to make branded stock photos of their cash register and payment processing products.</li>\n<li>These photos then show up on Unsplash for searches like \"Cash Register\"</li>\n<li>Then eventually proliferate out to the greater internet through blog posts and other mediums.</li>\n<li>Creating exposure for the brands, revenue for Unsplash, and nice little payday for some Unsplash contributors.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1200px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Square Sponsored Photo From Unsplash\"\n        title=\"Square Sponsored Photo From Unsplash\"\n        src=\"/static/fef525c5e04489b5790a35ecb0b02bdc/e5166/clay-banks-XvS-uKUoUao-unsplash.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fef525c5e04489b5790a35ecb0b02bdc/f93b5/clay-banks-XvS-uKUoUao-unsplash.jpg 300w,\n/static/fef525c5e04489b5790a35ecb0b02bdc/b4294/clay-banks-XvS-uKUoUao-unsplash.jpg 600w,\n/static/fef525c5e04489b5790a35ecb0b02bdc/e5166/clay-banks-XvS-uKUoUao-unsplash.jpg 1200w,\n/static/fef525c5e04489b5790a35ecb0b02bdc/d9c39/clay-banks-XvS-uKUoUao-unsplash.jpg 1800w,\n/static/fef525c5e04489b5790a35ecb0b02bdc/df51d/clay-banks-XvS-uKUoUao-unsplash.jpg 2400w,\n/static/fef525c5e04489b5790a35ecb0b02bdc/12609/clay-banks-XvS-uKUoUao-unsplash.jpg 3000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Unsplash gets paid so it can remain free, Brands get their products in front of a massive audience, and they <em>have</em> to hire photographers from the Unsplash community to take the photos.
