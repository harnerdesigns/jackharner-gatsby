Our inventory software runs some rules against the product data and sets various fields as various values we use to enhance the product pages across the site.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>When the theme templates are processed, the custom fields are passed to the frontend as an array of objects:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    'product'<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\n        'custom_fields'<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n            <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>'name'<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> 'Property'<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 'value'<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> 'Property Value'<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>'name'<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> 'Property2'<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 'value'<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> 'Property2 Value'<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n            \n            <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to whatever technical limitations or \"for security purposes\" this doesn't work:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">{{#if product.custom_fields.Property2}}\n\n... do something\n\n{{/if}}</code></pre></div>\n<p>Why can't they just build <code class=\"language-text\">custom_fields</code> as an object with the custom field names as keys? Require the name to be something that works as a JSON key with a max length and build it that way.</p>\n<p>{{{vert}}}</p>\n<h2>The <del>Solution</del> Workaround</h2>\n<p>There's a Handlebars block tag available called <code class=\"language-text\">filter</code> which allows you to filter an array of objects down by a specific property of the object.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">{{#filter product.custom_fields '&lt;FieldName>' property='name' }}\n    {{#if value '==' 'True'}}\n        Just Do It.\n    {{/if}}\n{{/filter}}</code></pre></div>\n<p>Biggest downside is trying to do things around your theme based on that value, you have to wrap your <code class=\"language-text\">{{#if}}</code> blocks in the <code class=\"language-text\">{{#filter}}</code> block. It doesn't look very intuitive and feels very hacky, but it works so it's what we get.</p>\n<p>If you have a better way of doing this, please please please let me know on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackharner\">Twitter</a>.</p>","excerpt":"At Shoolu, we take advantage of Custom Fields on products in BigCommerce all the time.
